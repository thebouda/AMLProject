As a part of the Advanced Machine Learning course at Politecnico di Torino, this paper will cover the work on the replication of the experiment proposed on the CIFAR10 dataset which consists of analyzing the effects that client's data distributions have on federated models. Especially distributions such as Non-Identical Class Distribution (each client has a different class distribution) and Imbalanced Client Sizes (each client has a different amount of data).
